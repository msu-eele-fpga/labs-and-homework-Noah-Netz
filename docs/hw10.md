# HW 10: RGB LED Controller

## Summary of the Lab

In this lab, we designed and implemented an RGB LED controller using three PWM controllers, controlled via Avalon registers. We verified its functionality by adjusting duty cycles to create different colors and patterns.

## Resistance Calculations

To calculate the current-limiting resistors for the RGB LED, we use Ohm's Law:

R = &\frac{V_{\text{source}} - V_{\text{forward}}}{I_{\text{LED}}}&

Where:
- &V_{\text{source}}& = FPGA I/O pin voltage (5V)
- &V_{\text{forward}}& = Forward voltage of the LED (given below)
- &I_{\text{LED}}& = Desired current for the LED (20 mA = 0.02 A)

### Red LED
The forward voltage for the red LED is 2.0V:
&R = \frac{5.0 - 2.0}{0.02} = \frac{3.0}{0.02} = 150&, &\Omega&
### Green LED
The forward voltage for the green LED is 3.0V:
&R = \frac{5.0 - 3.0}{0.02} = \frac{2.0}{0.02} = 100&, &\Omega&

### Blue LED
The forward voltage for the blue LED is also 3.0V:
&R = \frac{5.0 - 3.0}{0.02} = \frac{2.0}{0.02} = 100&, &\Omega&
