# Lab 10: Device Trees

## Overview
In this lab, we explored device trees, creating and modifying a custom device tree to create a green heartbeat led on our FPGA
### Questions
What is the purpose of a device tree?
A device tree describes hardware components and configurations to the os, which allows it to interact with hardware without hardcoding.
